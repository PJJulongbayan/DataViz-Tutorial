# DataViz-Tutorial

This repository showcases Python code examples for conducting data visualization in Python over several exercise files (.py and ipynb) - using matplotlib, seaboarn, folium, choropleth, wordcloud, pywaffle, plotly and dash. However, please note that the files within this repository do not contain deployment-level solutions. This repository is intended for educational purposes and is not a deployment-grade repository.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have Python3 and a code editor installed in your system along with the following packages and libraries:
1. Data processing, analysis and manipulation: Pandas, numpy,csv, json
2. Visualization and Charting: Matplotlib, seaboarn, folium, choropleth, wordcloud, pywaffle, plotly and dash
   
## Contents 

1. Exercises on data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn 
2. Exercises on data visualization using folium, choropleth, word cloud and pywaffle. 
3. Exercises on data visualization using plotly and dash
4. Mini-projects (putting it all together) to visualize the effect of recession on automobile sales and  analyze the wildfire activities in Australia. 

## Dataset 
1. Dataset are fetched directly in the code as they might change in content and form depending on the exercise.
2. For the mini-projects, full data description is provided within the code for reference.
